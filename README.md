# OraStoryRails
OraStory crowdsourced public speaking review converted to Rails

An app to practice public speaking or second-language acquisition on your webcam side-by-side with your favorite 
YouTube speeches.   You can create crowdsourced reviews for other users and manage 
your video collection to keep improving on your oratory skills.

If you are accessing this web app via the web, make sure your origin protocol is "https://" instead of "http://", as the getUserMedia() camera access now only works with secure origins like HTTPS
